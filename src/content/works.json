The 'AR Magic Lantern' is a handheld smart projector that tracks its own location and orientation so it can place situated digital content onto any surface in the environment.",

We are formalizing the elements of the Unity application into a game engine that is specialized for these contexts, making it easier for game designers, experience designers and curators to prototype and deploy interactive AR content."
